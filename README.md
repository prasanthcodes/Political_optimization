political optimization 




PO is the mathematical mapping of all the major phases of politics such as constituency allocation, party switching, election campaign, inter-party election, and parliamentary affairs. PO assigns each solution a dual role by logically dividing the population into political parties and constituencies. Moreover, a novel position updating strategy called recent past-based position updating strategy (RPPUS) is introduced, which is the mathematical modeling of the learning behavior of the politicians from the previous election.
